    <h2>Digitizing Human Rights: Privacy</h2>

    <p>
      With the advancement of technology, data privacy becomes more 
      imperative for users as they spend more time on the digital world. 
      The UDHR has one <a href='https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=No%20one%20shall%20be%20subjected%20to%20arbitrary%20interference%20with%20his%20privacy%2C%20family%2C%20home%20or%20correspondence%2C%20nor%20to%20attacks%20upon%20his%20honour%20and%20reputation.'>article</a>
      that states the right to privacy but we would like to elaborate more on 
      that with the context of the digital age. Privacy as a concept is very 
      elusive: not because it’s hard to define but because it’s dynamic and 
      influenced by companies and government choices. It’s dependent upon and 
      affects ethics, trust, and our current technology. It’s important to 
      clearly identify our rights to privacy as a symmetry of surveillance creates
      an imbalance of our universal human rights. 
			One thing to note is how we differentiate between the terms privacy and 
      security: privacy is about a user controlling how their personal data is 
      being collected, used, and published. While on the other hand security is 
      about the technological means or tools to protect that data itself.
    </p>

    <h2>Article 1</h2>

    <p>
			The autonomy over one’s own self is derived from one’s right to privacy. 
      Privacy is not a privilege but rather a right upon which many other rights 
      are derived. Securing this individual right will be a collective responsibility.    </p>

    <h2>Article 2</h2>

    <p>
      The use of personal data to create exploitation in pricing or discrimination in 
      services, employment, or other necessities is a violation of privacy, an inherent 
      human right. The influencing of user behavior built off of personal data is also 
      a violation of privacy.
    </p>

    <h2>Article 3</h2>

    <p>
      The abuse of data to create technology with negative impacts to the user is 
      a direct violation against the rights of the people who provided the data, 
      and restitution must be made to those from whom the data was derived.
    </p>

    <h2>Article 4</h2>

    <p>
      The data provided by oneself and subsequently derived from that data holds 
      an immutable and nontransferable ownership by the self. As this data is 
      provided to others, a chain of custody must be easily accessible, documented,
      and immediately available to the owner, who is the original authority with 
      notification.
    </p>

    <h2>Article 5</h2>

    <p>
      Everyone is entitled to the right to have their data recalled and removed from
      the possession  of all other parties. The request for removal should be easily
      accessible, quick, and clear to the individual.
    </p>

    <h2>Article 6</h2>

    <p>
      Exceptionally vulnerable populations such as children under 13 must have more 
      stringent security provided for their privacy. 
      Only authorized personnel may collect and transmit data on vulnerable individuals. 
    </p>

    <h2>Article 7</h2>

    <p>
      One is entitled to know which parties their data is being shared to and have the 
      right to deny this information to be shared. 
      A seizure of this data without consent is a violation of the inherent dignity of man.
    </p>

    <h2>Article 8</h2>

    <p>
      Information that may expose an individual's mental health information or 
      medical information should not be exploited by sharing this information to 
      third parties,  manipulate an individual's behavior, or put the individual in harm. 
    </p>

    <h2>Article 9</h2>

    <p>
      Encryption of data as a means of securing the transmission of information
      against unauthorized access is an expectation that should be afforded to all.
    </p>

    <h2>Article 10</h2>

    <p>
      Increased levels of security should not be priced higher, 
      as this is exploiting the fear of surveillance. A technology must include 
      security and privacy within its design.
